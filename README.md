# LDPC-PEG Algorithm Implementations

This repository contains two implementations of the LDPC-PEG algorithm for building Tanner graphs for LDPC codes: one as an Angular-Flask 2-tier application (`angular-python-app`) and the other as a standalone Python code (`python-standalone`).

## angular-python-app

### LDPC-PEG Simulation Tool (Angular-Flask 2-tier Application)

This project is a 2-tier application generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.2 for the frontend and Flask/Python for the backend, which implements the PEG (Progressive Edge Growth) algorithm for the generation and visualization of Tanner Graphs for LDPC codes.

### Description
Refer to the README.md inside the `angular-python-app` folder for details on how to install, run, and use this Angular-Flask application.

## python-standalone

### LDPC-PEG Simulation Tool (Python Standalone Code)

This repository contains a Python script that generates a Tanner Graph, Parity Check Matrix & Subgraph based on user input using the PEG (Progressive Edge Growth) algorithm for edge creation.

### Description
Refer to the README.md inside the `python-standalone` folder for details on how to install, run, and use this standalone Python code.
